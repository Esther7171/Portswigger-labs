zip file using gzip

gzip "filename"  it save with extention of .gz

   to extract we have two methods
 
1. gzip -d "filename"
2. gunzip "filename"


Gzip do not compress directory

we need to use tar to compress directory

tar --> tap archive

c : compress
f : file
x : extract
t : list the content of archive
v : verbosity

tar -cvf etc_backup.tar  /etc
         new folder   folder that we need to compress

look inside tar file without extract

tar -tf etc_backup.tar 



tar command combine with gzip to compress it 
we also can do tar and then pip it into gzip
but do it directly
 
tar -czvf etc_backup.gzip /etc
z :  compress

--extract 
tar -xzvf etc_backup.gzip
