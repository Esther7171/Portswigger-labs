The Linux Filesystem

Kali Linux adheres to the filesystem hierarchy standard (FHS),35 which provides a familiar and universal layout for all Linux users. The directories you will find most useful are:
•/bin - basic programs (ls, cd, cat, etc.)
•/sbin - system programs (fdisk, mkfs, sysctl, etc)
•/etc - configuration files
•/tmp - temporary files (typically deleted on boot)
•/usr/bin - applications (apt, ncat, nmap, etc.)
•/usr/share - application support and data files
